"""Application settings, sourced entirely from the process environment.

Both `_require_*` validators below are `# pragma: no cover` for tests/e2e
specifically: the live api process only ever starts with a Settings that
already satisfies them (see .devcontainer/compose.yml's MODE=dev/mock), so a
raise from either one would mean the process never came up for tests/e2e to
run against in the first place. tests/unit/test_config.py exercises both
directly and still counts toward its own 95% gate.
