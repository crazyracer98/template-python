"""Shared id/filter/bulk decision logic for the CRUD router factories.

Route bodies factored out of app.controllers.crud_router so build_json_router and
build_xml_router share one implementation of "id present -> single record;
otherwise -> filtered list, or a bulk update/delete over whatever filters are
given" -- each router factory wraps the same calls in its own response format
(a plain value for JSON, an XML-rendered Response for XML). build_json_router's
and build_xml_router's own public signatures are unchanged by this split.
