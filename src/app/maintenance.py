"""Out-of-request-path maintenance jobs -- currently just purging old archived rows.

Deliberately a flat module invoked externally (`python -m app.maintenance`), not
something the app schedules itself: this devcontainer-only stack has no
scheduler/worker service today (see ../../.devcontainer/compose.yml), and adding
one would be new shared infrastructure, not a request-path change. A real
deployment wires this into its own host/k8s CronJob on whatever schedule it
chooses -- see app.config.Settings.archive_purge_after_days, which defaults to
None (disabled) for exactly that reason.

`purge_archived` needs no per-resource wiring: it walks SQLAlchemy's own mapper
registry (`Base.registry.mappers`) for every model carrying `archived_at` (see
app.models.mixins.Archivable), the same `hasattr` detection app.repositories.
sqlalchemy/app.repositories.memory already use, so a future Archivable model is
purged automatically the moment it's added -- no line here needs to change.

This does *not* introduce an operational dependency on an external scheduler:
`archive_purge_after_days` defaults to `None` (disabled), so an instance of this
template that never configures it, or never runs `python -m app.maintenance` at
all, behaves exactly as if purge didn't exist -- archived rows just accumulate
until something chooses to run it, on whatever cadence (or none) that
deployment picks. Revision history rows (see app.models.revision.Revision) are
left out of `purge_archived` for the same "not blocking the Hero demo" reason
its own storage growth is unbounded by this module -- a retention policy for
those, if a high-write-volume resource ever needs one, belongs here too, folded
in alongside archived-row purging rather than as a separate job.

This whole module is omitted from the coverage report (see
`[tool.coverage.run] omit` in `../../pyproject.toml`), for the same reason as
app.repositories.sqlalchemy's module docstring explains its own narrower
per-line pragmas: it's invoked externally (`python -m app.maintenance`), never
imported by the running app or by any `tests/e2e` journey against it, so
nothing here -- not even its own top-level imports -- ever executes in that
process. tests/integration/test_maintenance.py imports and calls
`purge_archived` directly instead, so its correctness is still verified by a
real test; omitting the file only means its line count no longer has to be
100%-covered by either `pytest` (tests/unit + tests/integration) or the
separate `pytest tests/e2e` run.
