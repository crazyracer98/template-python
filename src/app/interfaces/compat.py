"""Generic backward-compatibility wrapper around CRUDInterface.

Wraps a current-version CRUDInterface and exposes the same CRUD operations
in terms of an older (deprecated) view, converting responses down to the
legacy shape and incoming payloads up to the current shape via
caller-supplied converter functions -- so a deprecated API version keeps
working against the same repository/current model as the version that
superseded it, without its own duplicated CRUD wiring.
