"""Opt-in record-lifecycle mixins: archive, draft, scheduled publish, and lock.

Each mixin adds one plain column, following app.models.base.IdentifiedBase's own
`created_at`/`updated_at` pattern -- a model opts in with plain multiple
inheritance (`class Hero(IdentifiedBase, Archivable, Draftable, ...)`), and
app.repositories/app.interfaces detect which of these a bound model carries via
`hasattr`, mirroring how app.repositories.memory already special-cases
`created_at`/`updated_at`. A model that doesn't inherit a mixin is completely
unaffected -- no shared base class changes, no new required column anywhere else.

See docs/adrs/0012-soft-delete-via-marker-column.md for why Archivable reuses the
same row/table instead of a second archive table.

    """Mixin adding an `is_draft` flag, defaulting to True.

    A plain, filterable/sortable column -- no repository/interface changes are
    needed for draft itself; see app.controllers.crud_router's `/draft`/`/publish`
    routes for the create-partial/complete-and-publish flow built on top of it.

    Unlike Archivable, a plain unfiltered `GET <prefix>` includes drafts by
    default (no default-exclusion clause is added anywhere for `is_draft`) --
    Hero's own worked example takes this as its provisional answer to "should a
    draft be hidden from a normal list the way an archived row is?" since a
    content-management use case usually still wants an editor to see their own
    drafts in the main list. A resource where that's wrong can filter drafts out
    itself with the already-generic `?is_draft=false`; resolve this properly
    against whichever real (non-Hero) resource first needs draft and has a firm
    opinion, the same "decide once a real caller exists" reasoning
    docs/adrs/0011-owner-scoped-crud-example-resource.md used for ownership
    scoping.

    Interaction with app.interfaces.base.OwnerScope: Hero combines both (see
    app.crud_1.heroes.heroes_v2.get_hero_crud), but with `read_scoped=False`,
    so every caller already sees every hero -- including every draft -- and
    "does a caller's own drafts stay visible to them specifically" never comes
    up for the demo. A future resource pairing Draftable with a *read-scoped*
    OwnerScope (`read_scoped=True`) would need an explicit answer (e.g. an
    owner always sees their own drafts even when reads are otherwise scoped
    away from other owners' records) -- still open, since no resource combines
    them that way yet.

    refuse to touch a locked row, except an update whose own data sets
    `is_locked=False`.

    That escape hatch checks only `data.get("is_locked") is False`, not whether
    `data` carries any other field -- so `PATCH ?id= {"is_locked": false, "name":
    "new name"}` unlocks and edits in the same request. Kept intentional rather
    than restricted to a dedicated unlock-only request: a caller who could send
    that PATCH already had write access to every field in it regardless of the
    lock, so combining unlock-and-edit grants no additional power, only saves a
    round trip; a resource that wants stricter "unlock touches nothing else"
    semantics would need its own dedicated route instead of reusing PATCH.
