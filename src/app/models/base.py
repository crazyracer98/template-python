# reuse -- acceptable for this template's traffic; front it with PgBouncer instead

# masking it either. "function" ends the dependency after the path operation but
# before the response goes out, making the write durable by the time the client
# can possibly react to it. Prefer this alias over Depends(get_db) at call sites
# so a new resource can't reintroduce that race by accident.
