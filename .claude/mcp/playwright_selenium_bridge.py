"""Launch Playwright's MCP server against the selenium stack service's
browser, the same way tests/e2e/conftest.py's `browser` fixture does.

@playwright/mcp only takes a static --cdp-endpoint, but selenium (Selenium
Grid) only hands out a CDP URL per WebDriver session -- there is no static
endpoint to point at. This opens that session, passes its `se:cdp`
capability through, and keeps the session alive for the MCP server's
lifetime (closing it would tear down the browser CDP is talking to). See
.devcontainer/stack/selenium/README.md and .claude/README.md.
