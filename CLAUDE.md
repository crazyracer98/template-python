# CLAUDE.md

The AI-assisted coding workflow Claude Code follows in this repository.
Conventions about the repository or the app itself — not how an AI
assistant should work — live in the root `README.md` and each
directory's own `README.md` instead; see "Before writing anything" and
"Keeping this file current" below.

## Before writing anything

Read every `README.md` on the path from the repo root down to the
directory you're about to change, in order (e.g. before touching
`src/app/`, read the root `README.md`, then `src/README.md`, then
`src/app/README.md`). A directory's rules build on its parents'; a change
that's fine at the root can still violate a rule set closer to the file.

The one exception is `.github/`: its directory doc is named
`CONTENTS.md`, not `README.md`. GitHub renders `.github/README.md` as
the repository's homepage in place of the root `README.md` if one
exists there, which would bury the actual project overview — naming it
`CONTENTS.md` keeps the per-directory doc without triggering that.

## Keeping this file current

When a prompt establishes a new method or convention for this
repository, decide where it belongs before adding it anywhere:

- A convention about *how an AI assistant should approach work here*
  (workflow, verification habits, context/token handling) — not a
  one-off task — belongs in this file, so it keeps applying afterwards.
- A convention about the repository or app itself (how a directory is
  structured, how a service is configured, a coding rule) belongs in
  that directory's own `README.md` instead, so a human contributor sees
  it too without needing to open this file. Product/domain knowledge
  belongs in `docs/`, not either of these.

This file should stay small. If a section here starts describing what a
directory *contains* rather than how to work with Claude Code, that's a
sign it belongs in that directory's `README.md` instead.

## AI-assisted coding workflow

Practices below are distilled from Anthropic's own Claude Code guidance
(https://code.claude.com/docs/en/best-practices), applied to this repo:

- **Explore, then plan, then implement.** For anything touching more
  than one file, or where the approach isn't obvious, read the
  relevant code and this file's directory-level `README.md`s (see
  "Before writing anything" above) and write a plan before editing.
  Skip planning for a change you could describe as a one-sentence diff.
- **Verify before calling it done.** A change isn't finished until
  something has produced a pass/fail signal against it — `ruff`,
  `mypy --strict`, `pytest`, or (for e2e work) the Playwright suite —
  and you've shown the actual output, not just asserted success.
  "Looks done" is not a verification step.
- **Address root causes.** Fix the underlying issue a failing check
  reports, not the check itself — don't silence a `ruff`/`mypy` error
  with a broad `# noqa`/`# type: ignore` just to make output green; see
  the root `README.md`'s "Checks" section for the narrow, justified
  exception.
- **Scope investigations.** When exploring the codebase to answer a
  question, read only what's needed to answer it, and prefer a
  subagent for anything that would otherwise pull many files into the
  main context.
- **Course-correct early.** If the same correction has to be made
  twice on one approach, stop and reconsider the approach itself
  rather than trying a third variation.

`.claude/hooks/self-check.sh` automates the fast tier of this (see
`.claude/README.md`) but doesn't replace running `mypy`/`pytest`/the
Playwright suite yourself before considering a change finished.

## Token efficiency

- **Read once, edit surgically.** Don't re-read a file already in
  context unless it changed since; prefer a targeted edit over a
  full-file rewrite.
- **No filler.** Skip restating the question and unsolicited closing
  summaries — state what changed and stop.
- **Clear, don't let it accumulate.** Between unrelated tasks, start a
  fresh session rather than carrying stale context forward; see
  "Compact instructions" below for what to keep when compacting instead.

## Compact instructions

When compacting, preserve which files have been edited and their
current state, the most recent `ruff`/`mypy`/`pytest`/Playwright output
verbatim (pass or fail, with any error text), and unresolved plan/TODO
items. Summarize away exploratory reads that didn't lead to a change.
