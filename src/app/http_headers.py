"""RFC 8594 Sunset header support, plus baseline security response headers.

sunset() is a reusable FastAPI dependency any route can opt into to advertise
that it will stop being available at a given time -- see
app.controllers.protected for the applied example. add_security_headers(app)
is unconditional middleware instead of a dependency (see its own docstring for
why) applied to every response, including error responses a route's own
dependencies never run for.

`sunset()`'s `link is None` branch is `# pragma: no cover`: every call site in
this app (app.controllers.heroes_v1/heroes_v1_xml/heroes_v1_web/protected)
passes a `link`, so a live request never reaches the no-link path.
tests/unit/test_http_headers.py exercises it directly and still counts toward
its own 95% gate.
