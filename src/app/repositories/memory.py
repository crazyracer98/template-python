"""In-memory implementation of the Repository protocol, used when MODE=mock.

Parameterized purely by a SQLAlchemy model class, matching sqlalchemy.py's shape --
adding a new mock-backed resource never requires a new repository class, only a
model. Unlike SQLAlchemyRepository, there is no server to supply `created_at`/
`updated_at` via `server_default`/`onupdate` (see app.models.base.IdentifiedBase),
so this repository sets them itself -- as naive UTC datetimes, matching the naive
`TIMESTAMP` columns Postgres stores them as (both conventionally UTC, per
IdentifiedBase's own docstring), so a datetime filter value (normalized to naive
UTC the same way in app.controllers.crud_query) compares correctly against either
backend.

Archivable/Schedulable/Lockable (see app.models.mixins) are detected via `hasattr`
on a stored instance -- a model without one of these mixins is unaffected, matching
how `created_at`/`updated_at` are already special-cased here.

tests/unit exercises every method below directly; tests/e2e's MODE=mock leg
exercises them too through the real HTTP stack.

A few branches below are `# pragma: no cover`, for two different reasons:

- Hero is the only model this app binds to this repository, and Hero always
  carries Archivable (see app.models.hero) -- delete()/delete_many()'s
  genuinely-hard-delete path (for a model with no `archived_at` at all)
  therefore can never run through any test here without a second,
  Archivable-less model existing purely to exercise it. The plan behind
  app.models.mixins keeps that path so a future non-Archivable resource still
  gets today's hard-delete behavior unchanged (see docs/adrs/0012-soft-delete-
  via-marker-column.md) -- it's real, load-bearing generic code, just not one
  this app's own single example resource can reach.
- Hero's own CRUDInterface always sets `owner` (see app.crud_1.heroes.
  heroes_v2.get_hero_crud), which routes every single-record update/delete/
  restore through this repository's own update_many/delete_many/restore_many
  instead (see app.interfaces.base.OwnerScope's docstring) -- so update()/
  delete()/restore() (the non-`_many` single-record methods) can never run
  through tests/e2e either. tests/unit/repositories/test_memory.py calls them
  directly, which is what actually covers them for the primary (`pytest`, i.e.
  tests/unit + tests/integration) coverage gate; the pragma only affects what's
  counted toward the separate `pytest tests/e2e` coverage gate.
